============================

This project demonstrates the control of an oscillator made with AudioKit (audiokit.io) by physical controls connected with an Arduino. 


Attribution

The sound synthesis is implemented through <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit">AudioKit</a>, an open-source audio analysis, synthesis, and processing library for iOS and OS X. This project uses AudioKit version X.X.

The OS X app makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort">ORSSerialPort library</a>.

Thanks to <a href="http://blog.andrewmadsen.com/">Andrew Madsen</a> for answering questions regarding the library.
